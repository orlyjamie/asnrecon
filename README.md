A tool to perform reconnaissance using autonomous system number (ASN) lookups combined with SSL cert scanning ðŸ“¡

## Usage

```
usage: python asnrecon.py

Select an option:
	[1] Full ASN scan
	[2] Specific IPv4 range scan
```

- Full ASN scan 

Using this option, the script will take a single domain/hostname which it will then perform a lookup against the local ASN database and select a list of IP ranges associated with that ASN.

`Note:` The script can take an input file `main.config` which can be used to prevent scanning specific IP ranges. IP addresses to be avoided should be supplied in a comma delimited format. 

- Specific IPv4 range scan

This option accepts an IP address range `0.0.0.0/0` and attempt to perform SSL connections while printing any identified certs
